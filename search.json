    "text": "Tidyverse is a helpful collection of R packages by RStudios chief scientist. They are installed to do proper data science.\n\n\nPackages are installed via install.packages(\"packagename\") . We also need Rtools to be able to compile R packages.\n\n\n\nThe pipe operator %>% is used to concatenate function calls.\n\n\n\nTibbles are data frames but have a better behavior. The term tibble and data frame will be used interchangeably. It is a better data.frame realization. data frames can be typecasted to tibble.\n\n\n\nData can be imported from Excel sheets for example. The data is stored in the RAM of the computer. If there is to much data or the RAM is too small, that might cause issues.\n\n\ndiamonds2 <- readRDS(\"diamonds2.rds\")\ndiamonds2 %>% head(n = 5)\n\n\n\n\nData can be reshaped with tidyr. Afterwards, every observation is represented as one row, each variable is represented by one column and every data tables cell contains one value.\n\n\ndiamonds4 <- readRDS(\"diamonds4.rds\")\ndiamonds4 %>% \n  separate(col = dim,\n           into = c(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"),\n           sep = \"/\",\n           convert = T)\nseperate() is used if one or more columns contain more than one value.\nunite() is used to paste multiple columns into one, the opposite of separate().\n\n\n\n\ndplyr is a grammar of data manipulation to solve the most common data manipulation challenges. This means for example the creation of new variables. There are different functions for different use cases which can be called.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndiamonds %>% \n    filter(cut == 'Ideal' | cut == 'Premium', carat >= 0.23) %>% \n    head(5)\nfilter() in this context with this arguments shows every data line where carat is more or equal to 0.23.\ndiamonds %>% \n  arrange(cut, carat, desc(price))\narrange()Â is used for reordering the rows, in this case for descending price.\nrename() changes the name of a column."

Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual .\n\n\n\n\nGoogle is great, Google your problem\nStackoverflow is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways."
