# Tidyverse

Tidyverse is a helpful collection of R packages by RStudios chief scientist. They are installed to do proper data science.

## Installing Packages

Packages are installed via `install.packages("packagename")` . We also need Rtools to be able to compile R packages.

## Pipes

The pipe operator `%>%` is used to concatenate function calls.

## Tibbles

Tibbles are data frames but have a better behavior. The term tibble and data frame will be used interchangeably. It is a better data.frame realization. data frames can be typecasted to tibble.

## Import

Data can be imported from Excel sheets for example. The data is stored in the RAM of the computer. If there is to much data or the RAM is too small, that might cause issues.
